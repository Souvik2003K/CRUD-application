# CRUD-application

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. In short it is a kind of todo list in which you can add todo's delete them mark them as complete or edit them as per your need.
In the top left-corner number of todo's will be displayed and upon refreshing the page the todo's willn't get deleted as I have used localStorage so without any worry you can use this todo for the daily purposes.

Given below are some screenshots of the web app -
